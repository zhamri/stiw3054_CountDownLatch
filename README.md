## CountDownLatch

The `CountDownLatch` in Java is an example of a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations performed in other threads completes. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that certain operations have finished before continuing execution in the current thread.
